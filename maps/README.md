# Ready-made maps

The maps offered when a project is created ("Nuevo proyecto") come from the sample maps that
[Kenney](https://kenney.nl) ships with his asset packs. They are public domain (CC0, see
`kenney/License.txt`): no permission or credit is needed, but we credit Kenney anyway.

| Map | Code | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Mazmorra (Kenney) | `kenney-dungeon` | [Tiny Dungeon](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon) 1.0, `Tiled/sampleMap.tmx` (32 x 20) |
| Reino (Kenney) | `kenney-kingdom` | [1-Bit Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack) 1.2, `Tilemap/sample_fantasy.tmx` (48 x 24) |
| Casa (Kenney) | `kenney-house` | [1-Bit Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack) 1.2, `Tilemap/sample_interior.tmx` (48 x 24) |
| Ciudad (Kenney) | `kenney-city` | [1-Bit Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack) 1.2, `Tilemap/sample_urban.tmx` (48 x 24) |
| Aldea (Kenney) | `kenney-village` | [Roguelike/RPG pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/roguelike-rpg-pack), `Map/sample_map.tmx` (columns 11-60, rows 13-42 of 100 x 100) |

The packs were downloaded from kenney.nl on 2026-10-27 (the Roguelike/RPG pack and the urban
sample on 2026-10-28). Tiny Dungeon is the same pack the game's
textures already come from.

## How a Tiled map becomes a scene

The engine's world is 50 x 30 tiles of 32 px, and every Kenney tile (16 px, drawn at 2x) becomes
one tile of the world. Each `kenney/*.txt` file is that 50 x 30 grid, one character per tile:

| Char | Kind | Char | Kind | Char | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.` | nothing | `#` | `wall` | `T` | `tree` |
| `b` | `bush` | `f` | `fence` | `B` | `box` |
| `R` | `barrel` | `^` | `spike` | `C` | `chest` |
| `v` | `villager` | `k` | `knight` | `z` | `wizard` |
| `e` | `enemy` | `a` | `bat` | `s` | `spider` |
| `O` | `brute` | `P` | `player` | `g` | `ghost` |
| `c` | `coin` | `p` | `potion` | `=` | `path` |
| `d` | `dagger` | `h` | `hammer` | `l` | `spear` |
| `t` | `staff` | `w` | `water` | `_` | `bridge` |
| `:` | `sand` | `m` | `marksman` | `n` | `necromancer` |
| `D` | `demon` | `M` | `mimic` | `r` | `rat` |

`path` is ground (a road, a sidewalk or stone) with no body. When a person, an enemy or an item
stands on a tile with road on two or more sides, the builder puts a `path` under it too.

  leave an opening; grass, flowers and signs: nothing.

The city, the village and the kingdom add people, enemies (archers, necromancers, rats, a mimic and,
in the village and the kingdom, a demon boss), coins, chests, potions and weapons on open tiles so
they can be played as they are. The other samples have no player, so each grid adds a `P` on an
open tile. The house is scenery: add coins or enemies in the editor (or with the AI) to give it a
goal.

Migrations never change once applied: 088 and 089 seeded the first maps, and the newest one
(`MIGRATION` in the builder, now 090) re-seeds every map with `on conflict do update`. To change a
map, edit its grid, give `MIGRATION` a new number and rebuild:

```
python tools/build_maps.py     # checks every map and writes the newest map migration
```
